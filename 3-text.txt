A person needs little:
to search and find.
To start with
Friend - one
and the enemy is one...
A person needs little:
so that the path leads into the distance.
May my mother live in the world.
She lived as long as she needed...
A person needs little:
after thunder - silence.
A blue patch of fog.
One life.
And death - one.
Fresh newspaper in the morning -
kinship with Humanity.
And just one planet:
Earth!
That's all.
And - the interstellar road
Yes, a dream of speed.
This is, in essence, not much.
This is, in general, a trifle.
Not a great reward.
Low pedestal.
A person needs little.
If only someone was waiting at home.
