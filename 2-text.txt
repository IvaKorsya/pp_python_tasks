For the sake of the dignity of life, one must be able to give up small pleasures and considerable ones too... Being able to apologize, admit a mistake to others is better than lying.

When deceiving, a person first of all deceives himself, because he thinks that he has successfully lied, but people understood and, out of delicacy, remained silent.

Life is, first of all, creativity, but this does not mean that every person, in order to live, must be born an artist, ballerina or scientist. You can simply create a good atmosphere around you. A person can bring with him an atmosphere of suspicion, some kind of painful silence, or he can immediately bring joy and light. This is creativity.
